Computer Graphics CS 559 Project 1

Uses two separate windows: first window shows a grid of spaceships built
with primitive objects like spheres and cylinders. The spheres are built
with a icosahedron and then tessalated based on a set number of sub-divisions.
Second window is composed of two viewports, one on the X-axis and one on the 
Z-axis with a wireframe frustum showing the view volume. The important part is 
that the frustum matches the first window first person view of the scene and the
second window accuratly shows how much of the world is in the scene.
